## Usage
- Run the data augmentation script to generate augmented samples
- Train the Faster R CNN model using the training script
- Evaluate the trained model using IoU based metrics
- Visualize ground truth annotations and prediction results

## Limitations
This project is conducted on a very small dataset, which limits generalization. The results should be interpreted as a proof of concept rather than a production ready system.

## Future Work
- Collection of larger and more diverse datasets
- Evaluation using mean average precision
- Comparison with one stage detectors such as YOLO
- Deployment for real time agricultural monitoring

## Acknowledgment
Image data were collected through field work by collaborators. This project is developed strictly for academic and educational purposes.
